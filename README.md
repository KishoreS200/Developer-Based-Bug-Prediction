# Developer-Based-Bug-Prediction
Developer-Based Bug Prediction analyzes developers' coding patterns, experience, and past defects to predict potential bugs, improving software quality and reducing maintenance efforts.
### **Developer-Based Bug Prediction Application**  

#### **Overview**  
The **Developer-Based Bug Prediction** application is a web-based tool designed to estimate the likelihood of software bugs based on developer and project-related factors. By analyzing key parameters such as experience, workload, project complexity, and deadline pressure, the tool provides predictive insights to help developers manage risks and improve code quality.  

#### **Features**  
- **User Input Form**:  
  - Developer Name  
  - Years of Experience  
  - Number of Recent Projects (last 6 months)  
  - Average Work Hours per Day  
  - Project Complexity (1-10)  
  - Lines of Code  
  - Deadline Pressure (1-10)  
- **Bug Prediction Button**:  
  - Uses machine learning or statistical analysis to predict the likelihood of bugs.  
- **Interactive Sliders**:  
  - Adjust **Project Complexity** and **Deadline Pressure** dynamically.  

#### **Functionality**  
1. **Data Collection**: The form captures developer and project details.  
2. **Processing & Prediction**: The system processes inputs and applies a prediction model.  
3. **Result Display**: Provides insights on the probability of encountering bugs.
